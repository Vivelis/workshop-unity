Unity is a cross-platform game engine (smartphone, computer, video game consoles and Web) developed by Unity Technologies.
It is one of the most widespread in the video game industry, both for large studios and for independents because of its speed in prototyping and that it allows to release games on all media.

The Unity game engine launched in 2005, aiming to "democratize" game development by making it accessible to more developers.

It has the peculiarity of offering a free license called "Personal" with some limitations of advanced technology at the level of the editor, but without limitation at the level of the engine. 

#space(1)

The software has the particularity to use the language (C#) on the platform ".NET".
It is a high level language, it allows to be free of memory constraints and to allow a faster and hassle-free development.
